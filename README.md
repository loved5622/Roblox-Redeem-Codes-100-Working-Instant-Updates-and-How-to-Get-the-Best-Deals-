### Common Issues When Redeeming Codes and How to Fix Them (H2)

While redeeming codes on Roblox is usually straightforward, there are a few common issues that players face:

#### Invalid Code (H3)
Sometimes, a code may be marked as invalid. This could happen if the code has expired or if it was entered incorrectly. Double-check the code to ensure it’s entered correctly and try again.

#### Code Already Used (H3)
Each code can only be used once per account. If you’ve already redeemed a particular code, it will not work again. Make sure to look for new codes if you’ve already used one.

#### Expired Codes (H3)
Promotions and event-specific codes often expire after a certain period. Check the official Roblox website or social media pages for the latest codes.
